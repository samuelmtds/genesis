    <section name="Business component model">
      <p>genesis' business component model is quite simple to understand. The
      following concepts and/or characteristics will be explained bellow:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#Use of business classes at client-side">Use of business
          classes at client-side</a></li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </section>
    <section name="Use of business classes at client-side">
      <p>The use of genesis' business classes doesn't have any restrictions.
      This means:
        <ul>
          <li>There is no need to create an interface for a business class.
          Other
          object-oriented best practices could lead to this - but the framework
          doesn't force anyone to do so.</li>
          <li>In order to build an object instance, one can use
          the <code>new</code> operator or any other Java resource
          (e.g. a Factory or the reflection API).</li>
          <li>There is no need to tell the framework that some instance should
          be managed by it. Currently the only required configuration is the
          aspects configuration that is done in <code>aop.xml</code>. This
          configuration can be copied from the samples and if some changes are
          required, they will be done only once.</li>
        </ul>
