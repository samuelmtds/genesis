      <p>A number of genesis features are implemented using aspects. AOP usage
      makes it possible to extend these features in a significant way with no
      need to change business or UI code. This documentation section aim is to
      describe these aspects so that advanced users can understand and customize
      their behaviour. In order to fully understand this section, AOP,
      AspectWerkz, EJB and Thinlet knowledge is required.</p>

      <p>Interface <code>CommandResolver</code>, contained in package
      <code>net.java.dev.genesis.aspect</code>, is used to determine whether a
      method is remotable or transactional or not. Below, it is possible to see
      the relevant code section for the interface definition:</p>
<source>
public interface CommandResolver {
   public boolean isRemotable(Method m);
   public boolean isTransactional(Method m);
}
</source>
      <p>Aspect <code>CommandInvocationAspect</code>, defined in the same
      package as the interface, has a inner class that implements this
      interface, <code>CommandResolverImpl</code>, that decides whether a method
      is remotable/transactional or not if it is annotated with
      <code>@Remotable</code> or <code>@Transactional</code> or if the class
      containing the method implements <code>Query</code> or
      <code>Transaction</code>, deprecated interfaces from genesis 0.1.</p>
      <p>If the value for the mixin parameter named <code>useFastMode</code> is
      <code>true</code> - that is its default value -, any method will be
      considered remotable, since in the provided aop.xml configuration only
      remotable or transactional methods are intercepted by the execution
      pointcut. This implementation is introduced in classes selected by the
      pointcut named <code>commandResolverIntroduction</code>.</p>
      <p>If it is necessary to determine if a method is remotable or
      transactional using a different strategy - based on an external xml
      definition instead of using annotation, for example -, one just have to
      provide a custom implementation of <code>CommandResolver</code> that takes
      this decision using this strategy and introduce it into business classes.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section name="Executing remotable and transactional methods">
      <p>Remotable and transactional method execution is intercepted by an
      aspect so that instances can be transfered (or not, as we'll see soon) to
      the server and an appropriate transactional context can be used for
      executing the original call. Besides that, dependency injection is done
      before execuction.</p>
      <p>Two components implement that: an aspect and a
      <code>net.java.dev.genesis.command.TransactionalInjector</code>
      implementation. Interface <code>TransactionalInjector</code> is defined as
      follows:</p>
<source>
public interface TransactionalInjector {
   public void init(Object context);
   public void beforeInvocation(Object target, boolean transactional)
                                                          throws Exception;
   public void afterInvocation() throws Exception;
   public void onException(Exception e);
   public void onFinally() throws Exception;
}
</source>
      <p>The interface implementation is used by aspects in a well defined
      manner, as follow:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Right after instantiation, method <code>init(Object)</code> is
        called with a context object as a parameter. This context object is
        execution mode specific - local, in an EJB environment etc. - and it
        allows the newly created instance to read user defined configurations.
        </li>
        <li>The <code>beforeInvocation(Object,boolean)</code> method is invoked
        before executing any remotable or transactional method. Its arguments
        are the object in which the method will be called and the transactional
        status for the call. At this moment eventual dependencies should be
        injected into the instance and that a transaction should be started if
        necessary.</li>
        <li><code>afterInvocation()</code> is only invoked when method execution
        happens with no errors, i.e., when no exception is thrown. It's when a
        transaction should be commited.</li>
        <li><code>onException(Exception)</code> gets called if an exception if
        thrown during <code>beforeInvocation(Object,boolean)</code> method or
        during execution of the remotable/transactional method. That's the
        moment to rollback the transaction.</li>
        <li><code>onFinally()</code> is always called and should release any
        resources allocated during execution.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Each <code>TransactionalInjector</code> instance will be used by just
      one Thread.</p>
      <p>By using custom aspects and implementations of
      <code>TransactionalInjector</code> it is possible to completely change the
      way transactions are executed and perform any type of dependency
      injection in business components. Three powerful execution modes are
      provided with genesis and explained below.</p>
      <subsection name="Local execution">
        <p>Local execution is performed by the
        <code>LocalCommandExecutionAspect</code> aspect. Basically, this aspect
        delegates most of the work to a <code>TransactionalInjector</code>
        implementation, as the following code snippet proves:
        </p>
<source>
try {
   injector.beforeInvocation(obj, transactional);
   final Object ret = joinPoint.proceed();
   injector.afterInvocation();

   return ret;
} catch (final Exception e) {
   injector.onException(e);

   throw e;
} finally{
   injector.onFinally();
}
</source>
        <p>Pointcut <code>localCommandExecution</code> is used to define which
        method execution should be intercepted by advice
        <code>commandExecution(JoinPoint)</code>. A
        <code>TransactionalInjector</code> implementation can be configured by
        setting the aspect parameter <code>transactionalInjector</code> to the
        class name. The context object passed as an argument to
        <code>init(Object)</code> will be the <code>AspectContext</code>
        instance the aspect holds.</p>
        <p>Class <code>HibernateTransactionalInjector</code>, that is also
        contained in <code>net.java.dev.genesis.aspect</code> is an appropriate
        <code>TransactionalInjector</code> implementation for this scenario. It
        introduces a Hibernate session in classes that implement
        <code>net.java.dev.genesis.command.hibernate.HibernateCommand</code> and
        it controls transactions using resources provided by the Hibernate
        session itself.</p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Remote EJB execution">
        <p>Another execution possibility bundled with genesis is executing the
        call inside a Stateless Session Bean, taking advantage of container
        managed transactions (CMT). Aspect <code>EJBCommandExecutionAspect</code
        > does that by invoking
        <code>executeTransaction(Object,String,String[],Object[])</code> and
        <code>executeQuery(Object,String,String[],Object[])</code> in the EJB
        instance whose remote interface is
        <code>net.java.dev.genesis.ejb.CommandExecutor</code>. Argument values
        for both methods are the instance for which a method will be invoked,
        method name, class names for method signature and values used in the
        original invocation.</p>
        <p>Advice <code>commandExecution(JoinPoint)</code> will actually do a
        remote invocation to the Session Bean instance. Pointcut named
        <code>ejbCommandExecution</code> will be used to select which method
        execution should be performed remotely. Aspect parameter named
        <code>jndiName</code> contains the JNDI address for the EJB home
        instance, while the boolean parameter <code>retryOnNoSuchObject</code>
        indicates whether execution should be retried (just once more) when a
        <code>java.rmi.NoSuchObjectException</code> is thrown (that may happen
        if the application server is restarted).</p>
        <p>Since method execution takes place in a Session Bean instance, the
        <code>TransactionalInjector</code> implementation resides on the server,
        and it can be specified as the value for an env-entry named
        <code>TransactionalInjector</code>. The context object passed as an
        argument to <code>init(Object)</code>, is the instance of
        <code>SessionContext</code> the Session Bean instance holds.</p>
        <p>Implementation <code>
        net.java.dev.genesis.ejb.hibernate.EJBHibernateTransactionalInjector
        </code> provided by genesis is the appropriate one for this
        configuration. During its <code>init(Object)</code> method execution, a
        Hibernate <code>SessionFactory</code> implementation is retrived from
        the JNDI adress specified as a value for env-entry
        <code>HibernateFactoryAddress</code>. The transaction mechanism used by
        this implementation is JTA, since only methods that use CMT are involved
        in execution. Rollback will be performed, if necessary, by calling
        <code>setRollbackOnly()</code> in the <code>SessionContext</code>
        instance.</p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Local EJB execution">
        <p>Executing the method inside a Stateless Session Bean instance with
        CMT through the EJB local interface might be a better option in some
        environments, such as web applications, for example. The aspect named
        <code>LocalEJBCommandExecutionAspect</code> invokes the
        <code>net.java.dev.genesis.ejb.CommandExecutor</code> instance using the
        exposed local interface and its behaviour is basically the same as the
        behaviour of the previously aspect mentioned,
        <code>EJBCommandExecutionAspect</code>, except for the following
        things:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The name of the execution pointcut is
          <code>localEjbCommandExecution</code></li>
          <li>Only the parameter named <code>jndiName</code> is meaningful,
          since there is no remote communication with the server</li>
        </ul>
      </subsection>
    </section>
    <section name="Executing dynamic searches">
      <p>Dynamic searches, i.e., classes that have a <code>Criteria</code>
      instance injected on them and have setters invoked for non-empty
      properties, are executed by the
      <code>net.java.dev.genesis.aspect.CriteriaCommandExecutionAspect</code>
      aspect.</p>
      <p>Every class intercepted by this aspect must implement
      <code>net.java.dev.genesis.command.hibernate.CriteriaResolver</code>,
      shown below:</p>
<source>
public interface CriteriaResolver {
   public Map getPropertiesMap();
   public void setPropertiesMap(final Map propertiesMap);
}
</source>
      <p>Method <code>setPropertiesMap(Map)</code> will be invoked on the client
      side passing only data that will be used for performing the search.
      Usually this method will be invoked indirectly by calling the auxiliary
      method <code>fillCriteria(HibernateCriteria,Object)</code> contained in
      <code>net.java.dev.genesis.helpers.CriteriaPropertyHelper</code>.</p>
      <p>Pointcut named <code>criteriaResolverIntroduction</code> defines which
      classes will have an implementation of this interface called
      <code>CriteriaResolverImpl</code> introduced into them. This is static
      inner class of the aspect. This implementation uses a member variable
      whose type is <code>java.util.Map</code> to keep and expose properties.</p
      >
      <p>Pointcut named <code>criteriaCommandExecution</code> defines which
      methods will be intercepted by the <code>commandExecution(JoinPoint)</code
      > advice. This method relies on information returned by
      <code>getPropertiesMap()</code> in <code>CriteriaResolver</code> to
      determine which properties will be used for the search, together with the
      method signature and argument values to instantiate
      <code>net.java.dev.genesis.command.hibernate.CriteriaCommandExecutor</code
      >. Method <code>execute()</code> will be called on the new instance. Since
      this method is annotated as <code>@Remotable</code>, it will be
      intercepted for <a
      href="#Remote EJB execution">remote execution</a>. This method initializes
      a <code>Criteria</code> instance (when the name of a Hibernate mapped
      class is configured for the annotation), injects it into the instance,
      invokes setters for search criteria and invokes the search method.</p>
    </section>
    <section name="Limiting method execution time">
      <p>Aspect <code>TimeoutAspect</code> allows controlling how long a method
      takes to execute; if the execution times out, a
      <code>net.java.dev.genesis.exception.TimeoutException</code> will be
      thrown.</p>
      <p>The time limit is configured by the aspect parameter named
      <code>timeout</code>. Pointcut named <code>timeout</code> selects methods
      whose execution will be intercepted by advice
      <code>timeoutAdvice(JoinPoint)</code>. This advice executes the
      intercepted method in a new thread and waits for its completion for
      <code>timeout</code> seconds. Any exception that could be normally thrown
      by the intercepted method is thrown back to the caller.</p>
      <p>The <code>keepThreadInstance</code> parameter defines whether genesis
      should reuse the thread which controls the execution timeout of a method.
      In case this parameter is set to <code>true</code>, the aspect will create
      and maintain a single thread and therefore all next intercepted methods
      executions will reuse the same thread. This way the application perfomance
      will be increased.</p>
      <p>However in case the application needs quite a few threads to run, this
      parameter (if set to true) will keep a lot of children threads in memory
      that might consume system resources - this way, in this particular case,
      it is recommended setting this parameter to <code>false</code>.</p>
    </section>
    <section name="Changing mouse cursor during event handling">
      <p>In order to allow a user to realize a time consuming operation is being
      performed, aspect <code>WaitCursorAspect</code> changes the mouse cursor
      to a wait cursor during a UI event handling method.</p>
      <p>Pointcut named <code>waitCursorExecution</code> specify which methods
      perform event handling and must be intercepted by the advice named
      <code>waitCursorExecution(JoinPoint)</code>. This advice saves the current
      cursor, changes it to a wait cursor and then restore the original cursor
      when event handling is done. It is expected that the intercepted methods
      belong to a <code>java.awt.Component</code> instance, since this class is
      the one that defines methods for getting and setting the current cursor.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section name="Instantiating metadata">
      <p>All form to view binding is based on metadata exposed by both sides.
      This metadata model can be found at
      <code>net.java.dev.genesis.ui.metadata</code> for forms and views. In
      this package, there are interfaces - <code>FormMetadataFactory</code> and
      <code>ViewMetadataFactory</code> -, that need to be implemented by
      classes responsible for returning metadata. Below there is a transcription
      of relevant code snippets for both of them:</p>
<source>
public interface FormMetadataFactory {
    public FormMetadata getFormMetadata(Class formClass);
}
</source>
<source>
public interface ViewMetadataFactory {
   public ViewMetadata getViewMetadata(Class formClass);
}
</source>
      <p>Aspects <code>FormMetadataFactoryAspect</code> and
      <code>ViewMetadataFactoryAspect</code> define implementations of these
      interfaces that use annotation for building metadata. The implementations
      are called <code>AspectFormMetadataFactory</code> and
      <code>AspectViewMetadataFactory</code> and they are static inner
      classes of the aspects. Classes that need to have these implementations
      introduced into them are selected by pointcuts named
      <code>formMetadataFactoryIntroduction</code> and
      <code>viewMetadataFactoryIntroduction</code>. To override the way
      metadata is created - by using an external xml definition, for example -
      one just have to introduce different interface implementations in forms
      and views.</p>
      <p>The <code>ThinletMetadataFactory</code> class and its related classes
      have been replaced starting from relase 2.1 by the
      <code>ViewMetadataFactory</code> class family and they will be removed in
      a future genesis release.</p>
    </section>
    <section name="Instantiating the form controller">
      <p>Updating the internal state of a form and firing events related to
      changes is performed by a
      <code>net.java.dev.genesis.ui.controller.FormController</code>
      implementation. The <code>FormController</code> instance is obtained by
      using the
      <code>net.java.dev.genesis.ui.controller.FormControllerFactory</code>
      interface. Its definition is:</p>
<source>
public interface FormControllerFactory {
   public FormController getFormController(Object form);
}
</source>
      <p>The <code>FormControllerFactoryAspect</code> aspect defines an
      implementation of this interface as a static inner class,
      <code>AspectFormControllerFactory</code>, that always return a
      <code>net.java.dev.genesis.ui.controller.DefaultFormController</code>
      instance. Classes that need to have this implementation introduced into
      them are selected by the pointcut named
      <code>formControllerFactoryIntroduction</code>.</p>
